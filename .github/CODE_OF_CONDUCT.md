# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We firmly believe in the **give respect and take respect** policy.

## What We Strive At 

### Be patient.
### Be welcoming and be friendly
We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people from all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### Be considerate
Your work will be used by other people, and you will depend on the work of others. Consider the global nature of our community when communicating, as you might not be interacting in someone else's primary language.

### Be respectful
Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. While we all get frustrated, it should never result in personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable is counterproductive.

### Be careful in the words that you choose
We expect professional conduct. Harassment, exclusionary behavior, and other unprofessional behaviors are unacceptable. This includes:
  - Violent threats or discriminatory language.
  - Discriminatory jokes.
  - Exclusion based on political talks/views.
  - Posting explicit content or doxing.
  - Personal insults, especially those with harmful intent.
  - Unwanted sexual attention or behavior.
  - Encouraging any of the above behaviors.
  - Inappropriate humor.
  - Persistent harassment.
  - Using offensive aliases or nicknames.
  - Using profanities.

### When we disagree, try to understand why
Our community is diverse. Approach disagreements with an open mind and a willingness to understand.

### Treat everyone equally
We are a community of maturity. Treat everyone as a sibling.
